Has all business logic encapsulated within a module using a state machine pattern for seamless testing independently of Discord.\".\n        Does the following response to the request fulfill the criteria?\n        Creating a full Discord bot with these specifications would be beyond the scope of this platform. However, I can certainly guide you and provide you some sample code to get you started. Here’s a basic example you can expand on, separated into two parts: the main bot code, and the business logic.\n\n### GoalsManager.ts\n```typescript\n// This class contains the business logic for your goals state machine.\nexport class GoalsManager {\n    private goals = new Map<number, Goal>();\n    private goalStatuses = new Map<number, 'insufficient' | 'sufficient'>();\n\n    createGoal(goal: string, dueDate: Date): number {\n        const id = Date.now();\n        this.goals.set(id, { id, goal, dueDate });\n        return id;\n    }\n\n    removeGoal(id: number) {\n        this.goals.delete(id);\n        this.goalStatuses.delete(id);\n    }\n\n    vote(id: number, status: 'insufficient' | 'sufficient') {\n        this.goalStatuses.set(id, status);\n    }\n\n    checkGoals(): GoalInsult[] {\n        const insults: GoalInsult[] = [];\n        const now = new Date();\n\n        this.goals.forEach((goal, id) => {\n            if (goal.dueDate <= now && (this.goalStatuses.get(id) !== 'sufficient')) {\n                insults.push({ goal, insult: \"You haven't completed your goal!\" });\n                this.removeGoal(id);\n            }\n        });\n\n        return insults;\n    }\n}\n\ninterface Goal {\n    id: number;\n    goal: string;\n    dueDate: Date;\n}\n\ninterface GoalInsult {\n    goal: Goal;\n    insult: string;\n}\n```\n\n### Main.ts\n```typescript\nimport * as Discord from 'discord.js';\nimport { GoalsManager } from './GoalsManager';\n\nconst client = new Discord.Client();\nconst prefix = \"!\"; // You can decide your command prefix\nconst goalsManager = new GoalsManager();\n\nclient.once('ready', () => {\n    console.log('Ready!');\n});\n\nclient.on('message', message => {\n    if (message.content.startsWith(`${prefix}newGoal`)) {\n        // assuming the format !newGoal goalName goalDate\n        const [command, ...args] = message.content.slice(prefix.length).split(' ');\n\n        const goalName = args.slice(0, -1).join(' ');\n        const goalDate = new Date(args.slice(-1)[0]);\n\n        const id = goalsManager.createGoal(goalName, goalDate);\n\n        message.channel.send(`Goal created with ID: ${id}`);\n    } else if (message.content.startsWith(`${prefix}vote`)) {\n        // assuming the format !vote goalId vote\n        const [command, goalIdStr, vote] = message.content.slice(prefix.length).split(' ');\n\n        const goalId = Number(goalIdStr);\n\n        goalsManager.vote(goalId, vote as 'insufficient' | 'sufficient');\n\n        message.channel.send(`Vote received for goal ID: ${goalId}`);\n    }\n\n    // Periodically check goals, could be done elsewhere\n    const insults = goalsManager.checkGoals();\n    for (let insult of insults) {\n        message.channel.send(`Hey <@${message.author.id}>, ${insult.insult}`);\n    }\n});\n\nclient.login('your-token-goes-here');\n```\n\nNote that before running this script you should install discord.js using either npm `npm install discord.js`, or yarn `yarn add discord.js`. \n\nThe above script is basic and doesn't handle bad input or numerous other edge cases. Furthermore, the checkGoals function is currently being run every time a message is sent, which is not efficient.\n\n\nFor further development, consider storing your goals persistently using a database, scheduling goal checks using a package like `node-cron`, and sanitizing your inputs.\n        [{\"name\":\"evaluateCorrectness\",\"description\":\"Evaluate the correctness of an operation and provide a reason\",\"parameters\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"correct\":{\"type\":\"boolean\",\"description\":\"Indicates whether the operation is correct\"},\"reason\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"Explains why the operation is correct or incorrect\"}},\"required\":[\"correct\",\"reason\"]}}][]":{"correct":true,"reason":"The response fulfills the criteria.
